This is a console application.

1) Type r or m and then c or s. No space inbetween.

r: rotate
m: move

c: change - add or subtract from the current position or rotation of the cutscene
s: set - set the position or roation of the cutscene

2) Type x,y,z values

If you are changing the cutscene then enter the amount you want to change
the cutscene on each axis.

If you are setting the cutscene then enter the new position or rotation on each axis.

3) (OPTIONAL) Enter a cut index

Enter the index of a specific cut if you only want changes to be applied to that cut.

Note: rotation seems a little buggy and might edit other cuts too even if you only edit one.

EXAMPLES:

CutsceneEdit.exe rc 0 0.4 0
CutsceneEdit.exe rs 90 0 0
CutsceneEdit.exe mc 1 0 0 
CutsceneEdit.exe ms 410 123 56 2
